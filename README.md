# Mosyle API Scripts
The purpose of this repo is to share some of the scripts I've made to support our intergration of Mosyle Manager in the Gateway School District.  I warn you up front I don't claim to be a scripting master and I'm sure there are better ways to do this, but if this repo helps just one person understand how to talk to the Mosyle API better or sparks an idea on how to use the API to do something else then I've met my goal.  Make sure to read over anything you intend to use here.  I tried to comment as much as possible and santize/genericize as much as possible, but somethings are just so "GSD" sometimes thats not possible.  In the end as one of our Apple SEs used to tell me *"mileage may vary."*

# What is this Stuff?
The *Misc_Scripts* folder is jsut one off stuff I wrote to do things.  Its interesting to read, but not really prime time.  *Scheduled* are actually deployed scripts which I have running on a Mac in my office which performs daily tasks.  See Readme in folder for a better explaination.


#Shout Out
Special thanks to Miko Brown (IT Director of Gateway School District) and Mosyle Support for their help in getting these things to work.
