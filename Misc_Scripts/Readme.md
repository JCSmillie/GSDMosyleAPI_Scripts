# What is this?
Just random scripts.  I don't schedule them, they are not run regularly, but they are useful.
* **99.MassiPad2Limbo.sh** -> Takes a list of serials, gets their UDID from Mosyle, and then moves them to Limbo.
* **TestGetClasses.sh** -> Attempt to export a list of class names and the kids who are in them.  I don't remember where I was going with this, but it didn't help.
